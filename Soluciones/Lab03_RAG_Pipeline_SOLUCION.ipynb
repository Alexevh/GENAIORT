Here are the most common ones:\\n\\n### 1. **In Psychology and Neuroscience (The Attention System)**\\nIn cognitive science, *attention* refers to the brain’s ability to selectively focus on certain stimuli while filtering out others. It\\'s essential for perception, memory, and decision-making.\\n\\n- **Types of Attention**:\\n  - **Selective Attention**: Focusing on one thing while ignoring distractions (e.g., listening to a lecture in a noisy room).\\n  - **Sustained Attention**: Maintaining focus over time (e.g., reading a long article).\\n  - **Divided Attention**: Managing multiple tasks simultaneously (e.g., talking on the phone while driving — which is dangerous).\\n  - **Shifting Attention**: Moving focus from one task to another.\\n\\n> Example: When you\\'re reading this sentence, your attention is focused on the words, and you\\'re filtering out background noise.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 2. **In Communication or Media (Grabbing Attention)**\\n\"Attention\" can mean drawing someone’s focus or awareness.\\n\\n- **Usage**: \"Please give the audience your full attention.\"\\n- Often used in marketing or speeches: \"We need your attention to share this important update.\"\\n\\n> This means: make people notice, listen, or care about something.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 3. **In Technology – Attention Mechanisms (AI/Deep Learning)**\\nIn machine learning, especially in models like Transformers (used in language models such as GPT, BERT), an **attention mechanism** allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of input data.\\n\\n- It helps the model focus on relevant information when processing text or images.\\n- For example, in translating sentences, the model might \"attend\" more to certain words when translating.\\n\\n> Example: In a sentence like “The old man walked slowly,” the attention mechanism might give more weight to “slowly” when translating to another language.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 4. **General Usage (Common Language)**\\n- \"I need your attention\" = You are calling someone to focus on something.\\n- \"The child has attention problems\" = Refers to a developmental or behavioral condition like ADHD.\\n\\n---\\n\\n✅ Summary:\\n| Context | Meaning |\\n|--------|--------|\\n| Psychology | Focusing mental resources on specific stimuli |\\n| Communication | Drawing someone\\'s focus or awareness |\\n| AI/ML | A method that lets systems prioritize relevant data |\\n| Health/Behavior | A condition involving difficulty focusing |\\n\\nLet me know if you\\'d like a deeper dive into any of these! 😊' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 524, 'prompt_tokens': 11, 'total_tokens': 535}, 'model_name': 'Qwen/Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507', 'system_fingerprint': None, 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None} id='run--51ddae2e-cf39-4fc3-af5d-3f3d256ca3d9-0' usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 11, 'output_tokens': 524, 'total_tokens': 535}\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"preprocessing-section"},"source":["## Parte 2: Preprocesamiento de Texto y Chunking\n","\n","### Preprocesamiento de Texto\n","\n","El preprocesamiento de texto es crucial para mejorar la calidad de los embeddings.
